Hi everyone!

Here is a little project I have started a while ago. It is meant to
become a little 2D game engine. It is still a project in development,
but I intend to complete it eventually. To build the project, you'll
need the libsfml-dev.Download it by entering the following command in
a Linux terminal:

	sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
	
After which you can enter "make" to build the project.
